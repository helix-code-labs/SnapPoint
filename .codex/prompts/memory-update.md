description: Strictly update .codex/MEMORY.md using the memory-updater workflow; fail on missing required context.
---

Use $memory-updater.

Task:
- Update `.codex/MEMORY.md` based on the current repository state and recent implementation work.
- Keep edits minimal, factual, and consistent with the existing structure.
- If critical context is missing, stop and report blockers instead of guessing.

Optional context from user:
`$ARGUMENTS`
